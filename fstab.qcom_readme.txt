This file has to be copied into the root vendor/etc/fstab.qcom to enable F2FS support.  This can be done with a root browser (Magisk installed).

This is flashed after the kernel is patched with Magisk and modifies the default fstab.qcom
Only data and cache partitions benefit from F2FS.  Flashing this ROM to a formatted F2FS partition will require setup off all data again.
Nandroid EXT4 backups will not work - Google and Xiaomi Cloud backups will.

Only TWRP twrp-3.3.1-37-cepheus-mauronofrio.img works for mounting F2FS partions currently.  It has been tested and works with this kernel.

The entire source code here is for China based ROMs (Xiaomi.eu, MIUI, RevOS) and Android Pie (9). 
Android Q has a different DTBO.img and causes a flash to fail. Code source is closed at this point so unable to fix.
